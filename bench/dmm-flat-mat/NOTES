More optimizations possible:
  - (DONE) in doBlockChoose, we should have a single GPU task that implements
    both multiplications back-to-back. This avoids one round-trip of the output
    data between CPU and GPU.
  - (DONE) in the GPU task, initialize don't do C <- AB + C,
    instead just do C <- AB, return the output C to MPL, and then let MPL
    use CPU to do the merging. This avoids sending C, and avoids all those
    nasty row-wise cuda memcpys.
